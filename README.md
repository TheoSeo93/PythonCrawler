# PythonCrawler, Heroku X Pyrebase X Apscheduler
Python Crawler for "SBU Foodies" on Google Playstore 

Initially, I tried to make a web crawler & scraper that uploads the data to the Google Drive and Firebase.

Then, I became lazy to update the menu by running the python script on my laptop.

So I deployed the python script to Heroku, run by python apscheduler. I manipulated the web driver options to make this headless browser look like a human browsing website. This file name is automated.py
